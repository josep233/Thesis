    I would first like to acknowledge the Crop Biomechanics Lab sponsors and the USA National Science Foundation (Award 2046669). Their financial support to the lab has given me the opportunity to perform exciting research while obtaining a degree. 

    I would like to express my gratitude for my mentor, Dr Douglas Cook. He shows genuine care for me as a person. He has helped me become a better researcher and person.

    I would like to acknowledge the students who have helped me complete my work. Michael Ottesen, the student who preceded me, helped me learn Abaqus, the finite element software used in my work. Braxton Fjeldsted, an undergraduate researcher, helped me take measurements for the shear modulus torsion testing found in this thesis. I express gratitude to both of these researchers for helping me with this project.

    Finally, I express gratitude to my wife Sophie. Her support for me during my graduate and undergraduate work helped me get to where I am today.
