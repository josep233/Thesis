    Maize is the most grown crop in the world. Each year, 5\% of maize is lost due to a phenomenon known as stalk lodging (breakage of the stalk below the ear). One of the most promising solutions to stalk lodging is to design stalks with superior geometry to increase stalk strength. Researchers have developed a 3D parameterized maize stalk model, but these models take a long time to structurally analyze and are missing important material properties. This thesis addressed these problems by developing an automated framework for analyzing the 3D parameterized maize stalk model, and by measuring the longitudinal shear modulus of both pith and rind stalk tissues. This thesis also identified the most influential geometric patterns in the 3D parameterized maize stalk model, which can be used to breed stronger maize. The results of this thesis are an increased understanding of the factors that influence stalk lodging, and geometric details for how stronger maize can be designed.
